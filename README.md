22AIE213 Machine learning

The project focuses on developing an efficient communication system for underwater acoustic networks, specifically tailored for coral reef monitoring. It leverages *Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)* to enhance channel capacity and manage interference in the challenging underwater environment. Machine learning techniques are utilized for channel modeling, resource allocation, and optimizing network performance. By addressing bandwidth limitations, high noise levels, and varying environmental factors, this work aims to provide a robust and scalable solution for real-time coral ecosystem monitoring.
